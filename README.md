## Description
- Devise a method to encrypt a message that can then be decrypted when supplied with the corresponding key.

## Feature Tasks and Requirements

- Given a document potential-contacts, find and collect all email addresses and phone numbers.
- Phone numbers may be in various formats.
    - (xxx) yyy-zzzz, yyy-zzzz, xxx-yyy-zzzz, etc.
    - phone numbers with missing area code should presume 206
    - phone numbers should be stored in xxx-yyy-zzzz format.
- Once emails and phone numbers are found they should be stored in two separate documents.
- The information should be sorted in ascending order.
- Duplicate entries are not allowed.



## User Acceptance Tests

- The ‘phone_numbers.txt’ and ‘emails.txt’ files will be verified by an automated system. So make sure to match the naming/formatting requirements exactly.
